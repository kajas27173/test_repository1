# Github Simplified
1) User Account > Computer
2) Repository > Drive
3) Branch > Copy of Drive
4) Commit > save changes you made in your code or files
5) Merge > you push those updates to the main Drive (master Branch)

.... TBC

# Another anology
1) User Account > main resource (contains multiple projects)
2) Respository > Projects (every project have different name but not necessary) > main Project file
    Readme.md (Description of the project)     
3) Branch
      - Main Branch - Production Code
      - Branch           - Development Code (Copy of Production Code (main branch) to make edits/modification)
 4) Comit > Save changes (save edits or modifications)
 5) Pull Request > asking for QA, if anyone like it then merge the update into their code (proposing your code to someone)
      It shows what changes (add/sub) made from the original code
 6) Merge > confirming Pull requests (reviewing other's code and adding it to your Production code)
